### Error Analysis:

* C0115/C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring )/ Missing class docstring (missing-class-docstring)
This type of error is shown when docstring is not written for a given function/class/object. Docstring is basically a description that describes what function/object is doing, its parameters and its return value. It is a good practice to write docstring for all functions/objects/classes.

* C0103: Variable name “zf” does not conform to snake_casenaming style.
Snake case (ex: snake_case) is commonly used in scripting languages like 
Python. It is showing error because the variable name is not following the 
snake case as variable name length is less than 3 symbols.

* C0301: Line too long (112/100) (line-too-long) 
This error is shown when the number of characters is more than 
suggested for ideal reading. More number of characters/symbols present 
on a single line decreases the logical understanding of the code and makes
code more difficult to read.

* C0103: Variable name “nothing” does not conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid naming). 
As your code is not contained in a class or function it is expecting those 
variables to be constants and as such they should be uppercase.

* C0325: Unnecessary parens after the ”if” keyword (superfluous parens). It shows error when a single item in parentheses follows an if, for, or other keyword.

* R0914: Too many local variables (20/15) (too-many-locals)
This error is shown as an indicator that the function or method is too 
complex, or trying to do too much.

* R0912: Too many branches.
This error is shown as the function or method has too many branches, making it hard to follow.

* W0613: Unused argument ”color” (unused-argument)
This error is shown when the function is taking an argument but not using it inside the function.
